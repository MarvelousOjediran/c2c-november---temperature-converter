#Create a program that first asks the user which temperature scale they would like to convert from (e.g., Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin). Then, ask which temperature scale they would like to convert to. Afterward, prompt the user for the temperature value and perform the conversion.

#input variable to find out what temperate scale the user wants to use 
temp_scale = str(input("What temperature scale would you like to start off with? (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin) "))

temp_convert = str(input("What temperature would you like to cocnvert to? (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin) "))
